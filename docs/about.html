      <h1>About Bail Bloc</h1>

      <p>Bail Bloc uses a portion of your computer's unused processing power to mine a cryptocurrency called <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>. At the end of every month, we exchange the Monero for US dollars and donate the earnings to the <a href="http://www.thebronxfreedomfund.org/">Bronx Freedom Fund</a>. They use 100% of the donation to post bail for people incarcerated in the U.S.</p>

      <p>Most users can expect to generate around $3 to $5 per month. Individually, it isn't much, but it adds up quickly. And, because bail funds are returned to their source when a defendant makes trial - which happens 94% of the time - even a small contribution accumulates over time.<sup><a href="https://brooklynbailfund.org/how-it-works/https://brooklynbailfund.org/how-it-works/">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>Bail Bloc runs autonomously in the background of your computer. All you have to do is download it.</p>

      <p>The app is completely legal, safe, and private, and allows you to keep working as normal.</p>

      <h2>Cryptocurrency isn't money, but it has real-world exchange value.</h2>

      <p>To generate any kind of cryptocurrencey, users run software that solve difficult computational problems. This process is called "mining." When a problem is solved, the user is rewarded by a decentralized, regulating cryptocurrency network (the blockchain) with units of that cryptocurrency. If enough users mine for the same cryptocurrency, it begins to have exchange value.</p>

      <p>Just like the centralized US Treasury prints money to infuse into the economy, cryptocurrency is generated "out of nowhere" through this arbitrary process. All the US Treasury needs is a minting machine. All miners need is computing power.</p>

      <h2>Bail has no grounding in the reason of justice, but it puts real people in prison.</h2>

      <p>Bail systemically coerces low-income defendants to forfeit their constitutional right to be tried before a jury.</p>

      <p>90% of people who can't post bail take plea bargains.<sup><a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/us1210webwcover_0.pdf">2</a></sup> That means they are never allowed to argue their case and can never be found innocent. Put simply, these defendants are found guilty of poverty.</p>

      <p>Because the American criminal justice system is unequipped to try the sheer volume of defendants it charges, bail streamlines mass incarceration by functionally relieving courts of the burden of litigation.<sup><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/go-to-trial-crash-the-justice-system.html">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>In other words: Bail is a means to an end, and the end is mass incarceration.</p>

      <h2>Bail Bloc is designed to put pressure on courts and bring an end to bail.</h2>

      <p>If widely adopted, Bail Bloc will produce a continuous flow of income for bail funds across the United States and enable a vast network of defendants to stand trial.</p>

      <p>With enough downloads, Bail Bloc has the potential to help collapse the perverse logic that the bail system rests on. Whether or not the courts would be able to handle due process without breaking under the weight of their own excess remains to be seen.</p>

        Bail Bloc is a computer program that bails people out of jail.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app is completely safe and private, and allows you to keep working as normal.
      </p>

      <p>Bail Bloc uses a small portion of your computer's processing power to mine <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>, a relatively new cryptocurrency that has strong privacy features and is much easier and faster to mine than BitCoin or Ethereum.</p>

      <p>All earnings go into a single wallet controlled by the <a href="http://www.thebronxfreedomfund.org/">Bronx Freedom Fund</a>, a nonprofit revolving bail fund based in the South Bronx. At the end of every month, the earned Monero are exchanged for US dollars and contributed directly to the bail fund.</p>

      <p>Most users can expect to generate around $3 to $5 per month. Individually it isn't much, but it adds up quickly. And, because bail funds roll over, even a small contribution can have a lasting effect.</p>

      <p>The code is <a href="https://github.com/thenewinquiry/bailbloc">open source</a>, and we welcome all contributions.</p> -->
