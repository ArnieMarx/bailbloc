            <p class="os-text">Bail is a means to an end, and the end is mass incarceration.</p>
            <p>Bail systematically coerces low-income defendants to forfeit their constitutional right to be tried before a jury. How? 90% of people who can’t post bail take plea bargains. That means they’re never allowed to argue their case and they never can be found innocent. Put simply, these defendants are found guilty of poverty.</p>
            <p class="bump-40">Because the American criminal justice system is unequipped to try the sheer volume of defendants it charges, bail streamlines mass incarceration by functionally relieving courts of the burden of litigation.</p>
            <p class="os-text">This is where we (and you) come in:</p>
            <p>Bail Bloc is an application that mines for cryptocurrency with your unused computing power and automatically donates 100% of that revenue into partner bail funds. If widely adopted Bail Bloc will produce a continuous flow of income for bail funds and enable a vast network of defendants to stand trial. Whether or not the judiciary can handle due process without breaking under the weight of its own excess remains to be seen.</p>

            <h2> BAIL </h2>
            <p>99.6% of misdemeanor convictions in the United States come from plea deals, where defendants forfeit their constitutional rights and are never tried before a jury.</p>
            <p>In 72% of cases where bail is set, it is set for $1,000 or less.</p>
            <p>87% of defendants are unable to pay and must serve pre-trial jail time, which means that the loss of a job, eviction, or deportation is likely.</p>
            <p>Defendants who are unable to afford bail accept plea deals 90% of the time, making them 9x more likely to plead guilty than those who can afford bail.</p>
            <p>When defendants out on bail make their court date–which they do 94% of the time–that money is returned to the individual or fund that posted it.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Bail funds accumulate.</p>
            <p class="os-text" style="display:inline;">“If the number of people exercising their trial rights suddenly doubled or tripled in some jurisdictions, it would create chaos.”</p>

            <h2> CRYPTOCURRENCY </h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies (most famously, Bitcoin) that have real-world exchange value. Unlike the US dollar, which is printed by the US Treasury, new units of cryptocurrency are created independent of any governmental oversight.</p>
            <p>Here’s how it works: Users run software that solve difficult computational problems - a process called “mining.” When a problem is solved, the user is rewarded by the cryptocurrency network with units of that cryptocurrency. If enough users mine for the same cryptocurrency, it begins to have exchange value.</p>
            <p>People accept and exchange government-printed money for services and goods because they believe it has value. Similarly, many people believe cryptocurrencies have value and are willing to exchange goods (including USD) for it.</p>
            <p>For example, a user is able to purchase a hat on the internet for 0.00122 Bitcoin from participating vendors. That same hat is could also be bought for $5 USD. This means 0.00122 Bitcoins is worth $5 USD, and can be exchanged for that amount.</p>
            <p>Just like the government printing money to infuse into the economy, cryptocurrency is generated “out of nowhere” through this arbitrary process. All the government needs is a minting machine. All miners need is computing power.</p>
            <p>Most computers only make use of a small percentage of their computing power. When you run Bail Bloc, a portion of your computer’s processing power is devoted to mining cryptocurrency, resulting in roughly $2 (USD) per month for an average user.</p>
            <p>Specifically, Bail Bloc runs mining software for a cryptocurrency called Monero, which has strong privacy features and requires less computational resources than competing currencies like BitCoin and Ethereum.</p>
            <p>With 5,000 active participants running Bail Bloc in the background of their computers for 8 hours per day, we project to generate $10,400 every 30 days.</p>
